# Remote Heartbeat Check
This feature is designed to send a heartbeat signal to a remote server to indicate that the app is running. 
This is useful to monitor the app's health and uptime.


Currently only https://healthchecks.io/ is supported.

## How to configure Healthchecks.io
1. Create a new check on [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/)
2. Copy the UUID from the URL of the check
3. Paste the URL in the app's settings
4. Enable the feature from the app's settings
5. Done!
