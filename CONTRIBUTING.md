At it's current state, the app does not follow any well known Android Architecture. Making app harder to understand and contribute.
Most code is also writted with assistance for AI copilot like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT. 

Feel free to open issue first to get some guidelines on how to approach any feature work or bugfixes in case you are interested to contribute.

Thank you for your support. ðŸŽ‰
