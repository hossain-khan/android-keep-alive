# Contributing to Android Keep Alive

## Current State & AI Development
At its current state, the app does not follow all well-known Android architecture patterns, making the app somewhat harder to understand and contribute to. Most code is written with assistance from AI copilots like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and ChatGPT.

## Development with GitHub Copilot
This project is optimized for GitHub Copilot development. Key files for context:
- `.copilot-instructions.md` - Project-specific guidelines and constraints
- `.copilot-dev-env.md` - Development environment setup
- `.copilot-firewall.md` - Network access requirements

## Architecture Guidelines
While not following strict patterns, the project maintains:
- **Repository Pattern**: `SettingsRepository` for data access
- **MVVM**: ViewModels with Compose UI state management
- **Single Activity**: Compose Navigation architecture
- **Reactive Data**: DataStore with Flow-based updates

## Code Style & Quality
- **Formatting**: Use ktlint (`./gradlew ktlintFormat`)
- **Language**: Kotlin with modern coroutines and Flow
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material3 design
- **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic, Compose tests for UI

## Important Constraints
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Do not target Android API 35 - it breaks foreground service functionality
- Current target: API 34
- Minimum: API 28
- Use `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission carefully

## Contribution Workflow
1. **Discuss First**: Open an issue to discuss features or major changes
2. **Environment**: Set up development environment per `.copilot-dev-env.md`
3. **Branch**: Create feature branch from main
4. **Develop**: Use GitHub Copilot with project context files
5. **Test**: Verify on physical device (permissions required)
6. **Format**: Run `./gradlew ktlintFormat` before committing
7. **PR**: Submit with clear description and testing notes

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for repository and utility classes
- Compose UI tests for screen interactions
- Manual testing on device for permission-dependent features
- Verify foreground service behavior

## Areas for Improvement
- Better separation of concerns in UI components
- More comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced testing coverage
- Migration to newer architecture patterns (MVI, Clean Architecture)

Feel free to open an issue first to get specific guidelines on how to approach feature work or bugfixes.
