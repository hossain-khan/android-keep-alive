/**
 * A background service responsible for monitoring user-configured applications.
 *
 * The `WatchdogService` periodically checks if the selected applications are running.
 * If an application is found not to be running, the service will attempt to restart it.
 * This service runs in the foreground to prevent the Android system from killing it,
 * displaying a persistent notification to the user.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Monitoring a list of applications defined by the user.
 * - Periodically checking the running state of these applications.
 * - Restarting applications that are not running or have been killed.
 * - Optionally, force-starting applications regardless of their recent running state.
 * - Logging application monitoring activities.
 * - Optionally, sending health check pings to a predefined URL if an app is running.
 *
 * The service utilizes [AppDataStore] for accessing the list of monitored apps and
 * [SettingsRepository] for configuration settings like check interval and health check details.
 * It uses [RecentAppChecker] to determine app running status and [AppLauncher] to restart apps.
 * Notifications are handled by [NotificationHelper].

     * - Launches a coroutine that periodically checks the status of configured applications:
     *   - It fetches the list of apps to monitor from [AppDataStore].
     *   - It waits for the configured `currentCheckInterval`.
     *   - It checks if each monitored app was recently running using [RecentAppChecker].
     *   - If an app is not running (or if `shouldForceStart` is true), it attempts to launch it using [AppLauncher].
     *   - Logs the activity using [AppActivityLogger].
     *   - If an app is running, it may send a health check ping via [conditionallySendHealthCheck].
     *   - A small delay ([DELAY_BETWEEN_MULTIPLE_APP_CHECKS_MS]) is introduced between checking multiple apps.
     * - The service returns [START_STICKY] to ensure it's restarted by the system if killed.

     * @param intent The Intent supplied to `startService(Intent)`, may contain additional data.
