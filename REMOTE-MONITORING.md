# Remote Device Logging
Due to nature of this app being always active and making sure the configured app is started if they were not recently opened, remote logging was added to analyze the app behavior over period of time (eg. days).

For remote app logging, [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) service is used for its convenient way to add and visualize data in excel like data sheet.

Here is a demo of the app logging on the Aritable data sheet
